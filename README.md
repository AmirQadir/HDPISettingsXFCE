# HDPISettingsXFCE
Custom scaling in Xubuntu and XFCE Environment

<b>This script will do the scaling factor job (In case if you have high resolution machine on a very tiny display. i.e XPS 13 4k)

<b>Important</b>
I have made settings based on 4k users. As, I was facing difficulty on my xps 13 (3200x1800). You can change the custom scaling factor to any point 0.5x0.5 (to exactly half of 3200x1800 without comprising its quality)


<b>How to Install?</b>
1. Download this script with this command: 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmirQadir/HDPISettingsXFCE/master/dpisettings.sh
2. chmod +x dpisettings.sh
